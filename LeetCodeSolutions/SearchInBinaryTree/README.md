You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

 

Example 1:
![alt text](image-1.png)

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:
![alt text](image.png)
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []
